## 2024-05-24 - Weak Session Token Entropy
**Vulnerability:** Session tokens were generated by truncating a UUID v4 to 8 characters (`[..8]`), providing only 32 bits of entropy ($16^8$), which is vulnerable to brute-force attacks on a local network.
**Learning:** Developers often truncate UUIDs for brevity/UX without realizing the massive reduction in security. A full UUID (128 bits) is necessary for unauthenticated session identifiers.
**Prevention:** Always use the full entropy of the random source. Use `Uuid::simple()` to get a clean 32-character hex string if hyphens are undesirable, but never truncate randomness used for security tokens.
